\subsection{Storage Durations}

Before implementing any sorting algorithm, it is necessary to
determine the most effective way to store the data to be
sorted. The C11 standard defines four diferent storage durations:
static, automatic, thread and allocated (\cite[\S 6.2.4]{CStd}).
Thread variables are new in C11 and irrelevant for our purposes, since they cannot be
accessed from outside of the thread in which they are declared. That
leaves three candidate storage durations: static, automatic and
allocated. Memory with static duration is allocated either when a
variable is declared outside of a
function, or when a variable is declared inside of a function with the \texttt{static}
keyword. Automatic memory is allocated when a varaible is declared
inside of a function without the \texttt{static} keyword, and memory
with the `allocated` storage duration is allocated with the
\texttt{malloc()} function or similar.

%types of memory? i don't know what language to use here
The C11 standard is silent, however, on how these different types of
memory are implemented. While allocated memory is most naturally
associated with the heap and automatic memory with the stack, the C11
standard does not contain the words ``stack'' or ``heap,'' leaving the
decision of how to implement each type to the compiler. In order to
determine the relative efficiencies of each type, then, it is
necessary to compare each on a realistic workload.

As a baseline, the single-threaded bubble sort was used to compare the
use of an integer array declared locally in the \texttt{main()}
function, an integer array declared in the global scope, and an
integer array allocated with the \texttt{malloc()} function. The
source code for each configuration is available in \textit{bsort.c},
\textit{bsort-global.c} and \textit{bsort-malloc.c}. 

The results are as follows:
